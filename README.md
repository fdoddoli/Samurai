# Samurai
Tinder divided by invite-only groups.

### Blurb
Samurai allows people to join invite-only communities for dating, networking, and making new friends.

In terms of actual features, Samurai works similarly to other dating apps. You can match with people, and send messages. Users are shown the profile of another person, and they can only start a conversation when both parties tap ‘like’ on each other’s profile. User profiles can vary between communities. A user might wish to choose a different profile for a community based on dating, from one based on startups.
